[[15982,1],0]: A high-performance Open MPI point-to-point messaging module
was unable to find any relevant network interfaces:

Module: OpenFabrics (openib)
  Host: node-3-12

Another transport will be used instead, although this may result in
lower performance.

|  ADVICE TO THIS USER RUNNING 'VASP/VAMP'   (HEAR YOUR MASTER'S VOICE ...):  |
|                                                                             |
|      You have a (more or less) 'large supercell' and for larger cells       |
|      it might be more efficient to use real space projection opertators     |
|      So try LREAL= Auto  in the INCAR   file.                               |
|      Mind:          For very  accurate calculation you might also keep the  |
|      reciprocal projection scheme          (i.e. LREAL=.FALSE.)             |
|                                                                             |
